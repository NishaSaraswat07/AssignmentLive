                    Until 2009, Sweden did not have a de jure official language.
                    In May of that year, however, Swedish was declared as an official language. Sweden has
                    also recognized Finnish, Meänkieli (a language related to Finnish), Sami, Romani, and
                    Yiddish as minority languages.

                    Swedish companies like Volvo, ASEA, Kockums, Atlas Copco, and Alfa Laval wanted to export their
                    products to the country and held
                    an industrial exhibition in Pyongyang. During that decade, North Korea imported various items,
                    including about 1,000 Volvo automobiles that were never paid for, prompting Soviet diplomats to call
                    it
                    "largest car theft in the human history". These Volvos were a common sighting in Pyongyang until the
                    2010s. They have since become increasingly difficult to maintain. North Korea still owes 2.2 billion
                    Swedish kronor(234 million euros) to Sweden from these imports. Out of all countries, the North
                    Korean debt
                    to Sweden is the largest,followed by Iraq whose debt is a billion kronor smaller.

                    The development of the "short-link" radio technology, later named Bluetooth, was initiated in 1989
                    by Nils Rydbeck, CTO at Ericsson Mobile in Lund, Sweden.

                    Rune Elmqvist developed the first implantable pacemaker in 1958, working under the direction of Åke
                    Senning,
                    senior physician and cardiac surgeon at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna, Sweden.
                    Elmqvist initially worked as a medical doctor, but later worked as an engineer and inventor.

                    The adjustable spanner was invented back in 1891 by Johan Petter (JP) Johansson. Two inventions,
                    the pipe wrench and the adjustable spanner, brought him fame, and changed the tool world for the
                    better.
